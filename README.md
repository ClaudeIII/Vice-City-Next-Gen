### Installation:

1. Copy/Paste over the .bat file from "1. Debloat Batch" to the game's directory and run it;
2. Copy/Paste over the files from "2. Main Files" to the game's directory;
3. Add the files from "3. Add via OpenIV" into the needed .img archives;
4. Copy/Paste over the files from "4. Optionals -> DXVK" into the game's directory if you want DXVK;
5. You can then launch the game from the .exe.

### Notes:

- Your saves will be stored in the game's directory into the "Profiles" folder. Note that a new game is required for any of this to work.
- IV.Scocl folder is for advanced users who know how to script and want to contribute.
- If you want to create a shortcut for launching the game faster, you also have a faithful icon to give it in the Optionals folder. It was included [from here](https://www.steamgriddb.com/icon/13380).
